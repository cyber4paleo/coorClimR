Description: This project is an R-wrapper around an API that stores gridded climate data
  and its metadata in a postgres database. This r-package allows users to get climate data
  for a single point and return the results as a simple data frame,
  making visualization and analysis easy. This package integrates with the Neotoma R Package and the VertNet R Package to support existing workflows.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.0),
